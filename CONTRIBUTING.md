## Some guidelines for tips
1. Tips should be practical, not theoretical. People who read your tip should be able to replicate it. Please no tips that explain ClickHouse internals unless they do so by way of showing a query or config example.
2. Tips should contribute something over and above the official ClickHouse documentation, either by providing a more detailed explanation of why or how something works the way it does or by giving concrete and specific examples.
3. If possible, try to explain *why* the tip is impactful. Be specific. For example, instead of saying "This will improve performance" say "This will make your joins more efficient and should reduce query response time by 3-4x".
4. Please include example query responses if possible.
5. If the tip demonstrates a performance improvement (e.g. query time, bytes processed, etc.), include before/after metrics with query responses if possible.
6. Please submit tips in English. Don't worry if your grammar or spelling isn't perfect.
