## Love ClickHouse, but need something more?

[Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) is a serverless ClickHouse built for developers; never worry about management, scale, or integration. Ingest data directly over HTTPS, from Kafka or your Warehouse, write your logic in SQL, and publish the result of your SQL as REST APIs at the click of a button. [You can use Tinybird for free, with no time limit.](https://tinybird.co)
